1. Overview
CyberLens is a browser extension that allows users to analyze IP addresses, domain names, URLs, and file hashes using various free online security tools. The extension is designed solely as a facilitator to provide quick access to external security resources. CyberLens does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from its users.

2. Data Collection

    No Personal Data Collected: CyberLens does not collect any personal information such as names, email addresses, or browsing history.
    No User Tracking: The extension does not use tracking cookies or similar technologies to monitor your browsing activity.

3. Data Usage and Handling

    Since CyberLens does not collect any data, it does not use, process, or store any user information.
    All actions performed by the extension occur locally in your browser without sending any data to external servers.

4. Third-Party Services and External Links

    CyberLens provides links to external security tools (such as VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Shodan, etc.) to help you analyze the selected data.
    Important: When you click on any of these links, you will be redirected to the respective external website. The privacy practices of those websites are governed by their own privacy policies, and CyberLens is not responsible for the data handling practices of those third parties.
